Summary: Here you will find some tools for working with bibliometric and alternative metrics for the analysis of scientific publications and their impact.

## Cite.py

This tool takes Web of Science data and creates an easy to read table that can be sorted on citations and more. It also creates keyword- and author citation networks in handy `.gexf` files that can be opened in [Gephi][https://gephi.org].

[**Launch Citepy**](citepy.html)

## Altmetric analyzer

This tool takes Web of Science, Scopus or a list of DOI numbers
and then calls the <a href="https://altmetric.com">Altmetric</a>
API to retrieve Altmetric score, citations from social media and
a range of other sources. Exports an xlsx and csv files for
further analysis.

## Woscop - Merge Web of Science and Scopus datasets.

Under construction.

## Network constructor: Create various networks from scientific database literature.

- [Web of Science keywords to gexf network file](/cgi-bin/keywordstogexf.py): under deployment, still buggy
- Web of Science citations to gexf network file (coming soon)
